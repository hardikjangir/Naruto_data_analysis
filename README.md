# Naruto_data_analysis

In this project, we have organized our code into four main folders, each dedicated to a distinct aspect of the project:

1. crawler
This folder contains the code used for web scraping the internet to gather a comprehensive dataset about anime using Scrapy.

2. character_network
Here, you'll find the code for constructing an intricate character network using Spacy's NER model for named entity recognition, NetworkX for network analysis, and PyViz for visualization.

3. jutsu_classifier
This folder contains the code responsible for training a text classifier capable of identifying various Jutsu types based on their titles and descriptions.

4. theme_classifier
Within this folder, you can explore the code used to extract the principal themes of Naruto using Zero-shot classifiers.
